# Hi 
We are a family with three children. We live in northern Germany. 
We love to travel, cook, take pictures, fish in Norway 
and make videos for our family archive. And we also love camping 
and hiking - if the difficulty of the trail allows all 
family members to go. 

 There are probably millions of blogs on the Internet, and 
 thousands of them will be good ones. So the likelihood that 
 someone will find our blog and be interested in it is 
 negligible. So why keep this blog? First of all, for ourself, 
 to keep some fun details or useful information. But we will try 
 to keep this blog as if we were read by hundreds of people. 
 Why? Just to learn how to formulate our thoughts.
